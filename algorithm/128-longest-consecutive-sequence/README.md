### Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O( _n_ ) complexity.

**Example:**
            Input:  [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]    Output: 4    ## Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
